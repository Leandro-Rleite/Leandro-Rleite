## Hi there, I'm Leandro Rocha Leite - 🛹 💻 ✝️

![](https://c.tenor.com/2h7enlv6ZWMAAAAd/streets-of-rage-streets-of-rage4.gif)

I’m fascinated by technology and programming. I always had the dream of working as a Dev, and currently I started to making it real by studying HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I'm also a musician, father of a fantastic little girl, and a fan of geek stuff!
Everyday I seek to create awesome experiences through well developed user interfaces. I'm 31 years old, living in São Paulo, Brazil.
If you are looking for a dedicated, hard-working, feel free to contact me.
